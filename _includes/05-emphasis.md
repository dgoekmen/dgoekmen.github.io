### Doruk who?

I was born in Fall 1995 at a university hospital in Ankara. Later, in Fall 2017 I have graduated from university in Ankara with a degree in physics. A number of things happened in the period between, which I regard as my _childhood_, e.g.

* I have met my first two friends

* learnt how to draw and paint

* learnt Turkish

* visited some countries

* learnt English

* learnt calculus

* earned a table tennis medal with our high school team

* decided to stop wasting my time not inspecting Nature more mindfully,

* learnt how to play the piano

* taken supervision from A. İmamoğlu, J. P. Home and M. C. Yalabık

* learnt German

* reduced my lack of sophistication on the message of quantum mechanics,

* and made a few more friends.
